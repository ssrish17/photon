Subject: [PATCH 06/10] Initialize fid->iounit during creation of p9_fid

In 9p, each fid has iounit feild, if iounit != 0
then read and write sizes are MIN(count, iounit, msize - HDRSZ).
for tlcreat/tlopen iounit comes from server
and in those cases vdfs initializes iounit to 0.
But in WALK/XATTRWALK cases its garbage value

This also is a performance problem with reads/writes,
where we require multiple round trips to server to
complete reads and writes. for e.g -> 400 bytes read
and iounit value is 2 and it required us to have 200
round trips to complete reads, but it is not the case
with vdfs-zero-copy, where we don't consider iounit
value for issuing read and writes.
